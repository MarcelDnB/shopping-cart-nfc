# shopping-cart-nfc

## 1. Overview

The project consists of a board situated in a shopping cart with which we can scan NFC tags located near the products which identifies it. This board indicates if a product is good for a specified costumer in terms of intolerances, allergies, etc.

The board that we gonna use is called ESP32, obviously we also have an NFC receiver, some RGB LED's to indicate how bad is a product for a specified costumer e.g. intolerance, an LCD because the costumer needs to select their own preferences and finally some wires to put it all together.
